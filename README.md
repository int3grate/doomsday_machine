## DoomsDay Machine NeoPixel Light Code

This code is designed to run on Raspberry Pi Pico, in a MicroPython environment. 

The code is written so that when ran in a MicroPython environment, it will use the MicroPython libraries instead of the mock libraries. 
If ran on a normal PC, mock libraries will be used that simulate the display.

It requires MicroPython Neopixel library and math library.

### Simulator Instructions

In order to run the simulator, you need pygame installed. 

You can run it with python on a PC with the included moc neopixel.py and utime.py moc libraries (all present in the same directory).  

#### Mac Instructions

Installing pygame:

```
pip3 install pygame
```

You can download the code here:
https://github.com/int3grate/doomsday_machine/archive/refs/heads/main.zip

Unzip that file and switch into the directory you unzipped it to using "cd" on terminal.  Then run main.py:

```
python3 main.py
```
